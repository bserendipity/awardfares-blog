On a recent trip from Europe to Asia I was able to find book an award seat on ANAs flight from LHR to HND that offers their new Business Class product "The Room". I had been looking forward to trying this for a long time.

## Lounge
Heathrow is definitely one of the best Star Alliance airports to depart from when it comes to lounge selection, with dedicated lounges from Singapore Airlines, United, Air Canada, and Lufthansa. Since I only had a short connection at Heathrow I decided to just head to the United Club lounge. It's easily one of my favorite bars in the world.

After a quick drink I headed down to the gate. Unfortunately boarding was delayed slightly so I ended up just waiting in line for a few minutes.

## Seat / Cabin
The new Business Class seat is huge. The seat is very similar to Qatar Airways QSuite. However, I would say I definitely prefer the QR seat for lounging, has better privacy, more storage.

The sliding door and panel had to be open during service (presumably to make it easier for the crew), however this definitely reduced the privacy. There is essentially no privacy to the side during the meal service since the seats are only slightly staggered.

Pre-departure beverage was served in a plastic cup, which felt cheap. Unfortunately a forgot to bring any clothes to sleep in, and ANA don't offer any sleeping wear. Instead they offer a cardigan which I really don't understand the point of. I didn't use it.

The business cabin consists of 3 sections. One large section in the middle and two smaller sections forwards to front and back. If possible I would definitely choose the smaller sections as long as you can get a rear-facing seat (which have slightly better privacy).

## Meal / Service
A western menu and Japanese menu were offered. I intended to order the Japanese menu, however, the cabin crew actually recommended I don't choose the Japanese menu since he thought the quality wasn't as good on the ex-London flights. I guess I appreciated the advice, but felt it was odd that they would offer something that they don't recommend. The western food was very good at least.

Service was friendly but quite slow at times. The business class cabin on this aircraft is huge and they have a lot of passengers to take care of. However I felt the crew was perhaps a bit understaffed. At times I had to wait a long time to get a refill on my drink (or even had to remind them multiple times). Unfortunately the service wasn't very proactive.

## Bed
The bed is huge and very comfortable. Since the foot-well is off towards one side you end up sleeping diagonally for best legroom. Being able to close the sliding door and panel definitely gives you excellent privacy and makes sleeping a lot more comfortable in my opinion.

## Toilet
In a typical Japanese fashion, the toilets even have a bidet/spray feature.

## Arrival
After what felt like a very short flight we soon arrived into Tokyo Haneda.

## Summary
Overall a very good hard product and a decent soft product. It didn't quite live up to my expectations, especially when comparing to Qatar Airways QSuite. However, it's definitely an excellent Business option and I'm looking forward to this product becoming available on more ANA routes in the future. 

Be sure to look for the "2019 Cabin" annotation in AwardFares:

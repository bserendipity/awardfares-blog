Earlier during the year SAS stopped the ability to book Star Alliance awards using Eurobonus points. However, they have now restarted the ability to book these flights, but the service is currently only over phone. The online booking is still not available at this time.

Here's a summary of all the award booking services currently offered by SAS, and what the current status is as of July 22, 2020.

|Service|Available|
|--|--|
| Book **SAS** awards using Eurobonus points online and by phone | Yes |

| Book **Star Alliance** awards using Eurobonus points **online** | No |
| Book with 2-4-1 vouchers for SAS and Star Alliance award flights| Yes |
| Book with FlyPremium for SAS award flights | Yes |

Note that for 2-4-1 vouchers that expire 2020 used for a flights that take place during 2021, if the flight gets cancelled then your voucher will get extended. This is normally not the case.

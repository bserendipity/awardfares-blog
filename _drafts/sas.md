Earlier during the year SAS stopped the ability to book Star Alliance awards using Eurobonus points. However, they have now restarted the ability to book these flights, but the service is currently only over phone. The online booking is still not available at this time.

Here's a summary of all the award booking services currently offered by SAS, and what the current status is as of July 22, 2020.

|Service|Available|
|--|--|
| Book **SAS** awards using Eurobonus points online and by phone | Yes |
| Book **Star Alliance** awards using Eurobonus points by **phone** | Yes |
| Book **Star Alliance** awards using Eurobonus points **online** | No |
| Book with 2-4-1 vouchers for SAS and Star Alliance award flights| Yes |
| Book with FlyPremium for SAS award flights | Yes |

Opening hours and contact details for booking via phone:

+46(0)18-480 91 67  
Monday to Friday: 9-17

Notes:

1) When calling to book Star Alliance awards, the automated phone reply still says that booking new flights is not available, but this message hasn't been updated yet.

2) There are still some additional restrictions in place. For example, currently Singapore Airlines does not release any award space to partners.

3) Furthermore, there are still many travel restrictions in place, so to be on the safe side, it's probably best to plan your travel for in the future.

Stay safe!

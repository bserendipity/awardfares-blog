The premium economy cabin on the [777-300ER](https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Air_Canada/Air_Canada_Boeing_777-300ER_Three_Class_v3.php) is small with only 3 rows. Even so, the premium economy cabin receives dedicated service, which makes the experience feel quite premium.

As usual, I usually opt for the first row since I like not having a seat infront of me. The legroom was decent.

Menu cards were handed out before departure and service started with a pre-departure drink with a choice of juice or water.

While presentation could be improved, the meal was really tasty and the portion was quite good. No complaints!

## Summary
Overall a decent premium economy product. Service was good, food was tasty and the seat was comfortable. The small cabin, dedicated service, and small touches made the product feel like a premium product (rather than just a slightly upgraded version of economy).

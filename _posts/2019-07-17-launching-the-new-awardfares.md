During the last few months we've been working very hard on a completely new version of AwardFares with many new features and improvements. Today we're launching the new version to everyone together with a new Diamond tier.

## New Diamond tier
Many have asked for more custom searches and alerts. Today we're also launching a new Diamond tier, which offers unlimited custom searches and unlimited alerts. During the first week (until July 25, 2019) we're offering a **25% discount** on all new Diamond plans (monthly and yearly).

*Note: Upgrades from Gold to Diamond are prorated, so any remaining time on an existing Gold subscription will be deducted off of a new Diamond subscription.*

## Redesigned search page
The main search page has been completely redesigned, with a new timeline, map, journey builder, and flights list. Our top priority was to make the UI easier to use, especially for custom searches (see below).

## Easier custom searches
Simply enter an origin, destination, and a departure date. The page will automatically start loading results for you. You can still click the search icon in the timeline to search multiple dates at once. Requires Gold or Diamond.

## Per-program award availability
Expanding a flight now automatically searches and displays availability per frequent flyer program. Currently this supports United MileagePlus, Air Canada Aeroplan, SAS EuroBonus, and Avianca LifeMiles. More providers coming soon! Requires Gold or Diamond.

## Search up to 6 airports at once
Furthermore, you can now enter up to 6 airports at once for custom searches. For example, 3 origin airports + 3 destination airports, or 1 origin + 5 destinations, etc...

## New continent location filters
Besides the existing Award Zone filters you can now also search by continent. This is especially useful when searching all of Asia at once.

## Track searches
When searching a specific route and date you can now easily create an alert using the "Track" search feature.

## New logo and branding
As you may also have noticed, we now have a brand new logo and icon. We hope you like it as much as we do! All of the new can be found on our [Press](https://awardfares.com/press) page.

## Other changes
- Previously free users could see the exact number of award seats availability on a flight. From now on this is only available to Gold and Diamond users, and free users will only see whether or not any awards are available in each cabin.
- Availability can now only be refreshed once every hour for Gold users. Real-time updates will from now on require a Diamond subscription.
